# DotNet Forum Starter

A forum app built with ASP.NET Core 2.0. Uses ASP.NET Core Identity for user membership

This app provides a starting point for developing a Forum Application with:
- Forums, Posts, and Replies
- User Profiles
- Home Page with Latest Posts
- Post Content Search
- Unit testing with NUnit, FluentAssertions
- Custom CSS

I created a video series demonstrating the building of this code at [ProductiveDev](https://productivedev.com/product/net-core-2-0-mvc-forum-application-course/).
